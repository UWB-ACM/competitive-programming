# What is competitive programming?
Competitive programming is an intellectual e-sport where coders race to solve the most algorithmic problems within a limited amount of time. Judging is based mostly upon number of problems solved and time spent for writing successful solutions, but may also include other factors (quality of output produced, execution time, program size, etc.). HackerRank is ultimized for our contests.

Competitive programming is recognized and supported by many multinational software and Internet companies such as Google and Facebook. There are several organizations who host programming competitions on a regular basis.
